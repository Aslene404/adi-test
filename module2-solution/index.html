	<div class="box1">
		
		<h2 id="head1">Vata</h2>
		<p>Vata embodies the energy of movement and is therefore often associated with wind (and the air element). Vata is linked to creativity and flexibility; it governs all movement—the flow of the breath, the pulsation of the heart, all muscle contractions, tissue movements, cellular mobility—and communication throughout the mind and the nervous system.</p>
		
	</div>


	<div class="box2">
		
		<h2 id="head2">Pitta</h2>
		<p>Pitta represents the energy of transformation and is therefore closely aligned with the fire element. But in living organisms, pitta is largely liquid, which is why water is its secondary element. Pitta is neither mobile nor stable, but spreads—much as the warmth of a fire permeates its surroundings, or as water flows in the direction dictated by the terrain.</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="box3">
		
		<h2 id="head3">Kapha</h2>
		<p>Kapha lends structure, solidity, and cohesiveness to all things, and is therefore associated primarily with the earth and water elements. It triggers cold. Kapha also embodies the watery energies of love and compassion. This dosha hydrates all cells and systems, lubricates the joints, moisturizes the skin, maintains immunity, and protects the tissues.</p>
